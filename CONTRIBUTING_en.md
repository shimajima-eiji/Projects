# This repository manages or decides the operation policy.
I would like to exchange opinions through discussions.

# problem
Rather than saying "I'm expecting this kind of thing" to the contributors, I will write down the problems that I have now, so I wonder if it will be a contribution if I have a discussion from where you can give me an opinion. think.
I'm enthusiastic about the documentation, so I'll do my best, although the progress is slow.

## Issue is crossing the repository.
Tired of setting labels and milestones in each repository ...
We are proceeding with the policy of putting together operation-related items in this repository once, but the structure is like an object-oriented class that is too responsible and poorly made, so I would like to do something when I notice it.

## Issue is easily created too much and flooded
I make it in this format

`-[] Issue title`

Thanks to that, I can write bang bang for each task, but even if I do something like "fix #ID" in the commit message, it is not reflected, so the task association is bad.
Actually, I think there are some issues that have already been supported, but they have not been maintained.

## I want to monetize
I have a lot of Github know-how, so I want to use it in the right place.
Will it be published in Zenn for the time being? It is a feeling. The goal is a technical book!

## I want to spread the job hunting and job change project on Github
It's good for people and agents with whom I have a relationship, but it's not well recognized by the hired side, so I'd like to do my best together.
The compatibility between Github and personnel is not very good, so the problem is that I can only make use of the method of doing it quantitatively in HR ...

## community
I don't know what I can do, but I want an environment where I can feel free to enjoy myself.
It's more like a meet-up than the Mokumoku-kai.

You may make it with connpass.

# About Prulik
Since it is not placed in this repository, it may be difficult to get an image.
At the bottom of my profile page, I can track which repository I'm active in recently, so it might be a good idea to have the contents of the actively active repository read diagonally.

I'm a bad programmer who writes documentation after it's completed because it's reopening because it's personal development.
If you think that there are people who are watching it, you may start to focus on documentation.
(For the time being, I intend to be highly interested in documentation, knowledge management, and UX in practice.)

# About Documentation
Since there is a mechanism to convert `.md` to` _en.md`, I think that I can reach English-speaking countries, but unfortunately I can hardly say English, so the translation result Cannot be determined if is correct.
I think the easiest contribution is to have the translated content scrutinized for correctness.

I can translate it into other languages, so I'm wondering if I should prepare a template other than English (Chinese, Russian, Spanish, etc.).
